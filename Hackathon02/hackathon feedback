Purim Basket App.
First of all I'd like to say good job in picking a project relevant to the time of year!
A very fun and colorful app.
I can see that you control requests to the database : Delete & Insert.
Also your file structure is excellent! Routes, Modules & controllers. Exactly how its done !
What about an option to update the basket? That would be easy for you to do!
Really good work , very excited to see what you will create on your final project.
